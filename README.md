| * lwxConsoleTools project   - plays soundfiles from the Console :-)       +
|                           a nicer replacement for the Beep                +
| * lwxDownloadAndExecute - Downloads a file and executes it with /silent   +
|                           and /passive MSI tags (if the executable can    +
|                           handle it)                                      +

|                           regSvr32.dll on all exe and DLL files in the    +
